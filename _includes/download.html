                        <p>Julia is a LASA sophomore interested in computer science and the empowerment of 
                            other individuals (specifically minorities) in the field as well. 
                            Her participation in hackathons has been an eye-opener to the universality and applications 
                            of coding, and she aims to allow others to be able to have the same experience. Aside from 
                            computer science, Julia enjoys mathematics as well as playing the cello.
